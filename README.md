## Hi there 👋

🌟**Data Analyst** | **Visualization Enthusiast** | **Risk Management Expert**|

Welcome! I'm Ketan, a data-driven problem solver. I enjoy translating voluminous datasets &  I’m all about digging into the details and creating dashboards and reports that aren’t just informative but also easy to understand.

🔍 **A Little About Me:**
For the past three years, I’ve been working across multiple projects transforming complex datasets into clear insights to help the decision-makers.
**My favorite part of the job:** Building interactive visual dashboards that bring the data alive. Developing insights from Power BI reports to analyse past & future trends to make an informed decision

Whether it’s simplifying and managing data with **DAX queries** or cutting down hours of manual work to get an insight into the datasets by developing the **KPI's** for the mid scaled businesses, I’m always looking for ways to work smarter. Data is at the heart of everything I do, and I’m passionate about finding patterns and evolving with the same that drive real-world impact.

🛠 **The Tools in My Toolbox:**
Data Crunching:  SQL, DAX for slicing and dicing complex datasets

**Visual Storytelling** 
Power BI, Excel (Advanced), Power Query to build engaging reports

**Automation & Management:**
Pivot Tables, MACROS

🚀 **What I’m Working On:**
Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in data visualization and Microsoft Fabric to take data solutions up a notch. Stay tuned for more repos soon, where I’ll be showcasing everything from price prediction models to large-scale data visualizations.
